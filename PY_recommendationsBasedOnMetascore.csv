an-american-carol;10;MikeG.;;Oct  5, 2008;"[ ""While the movie doesn't deserve a 10, it doesn't deserve a 0 either. People's political views tend to distort their perceptions. This is a great comedy for those who can laugh a little at stupid democrat American politics, republicans have to watch democrat propaganda in just about every piece of media and Hollywood creation, so shut up, ppl like tab, go watch Saturday night live,and let us enjoy a movie that makes fun of your loser political views."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.5
united-93;10;MikeG.;;May 14, 2007;"[ ""Probably the most terrifying film ever made and certainly the best film of 2006. The pacing here is nothing short of demonic, but what elevates this film to the level of \""masterpiece\"" is that it contains a stunning veracity that is as lyrical as it is painstakingly real. By not sensationalizing, by refusing to exploit, it stands in direct opposition to the glorified manipulations of the post-9/11 experience. This is a truly great film."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.5

Be prepared for a little violence, nudity, and political commentary and you will be well served."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.5

artificial-intelligence-ai;9;MikeG.;;Dec  7, 2005;"[ ""I was blown away by the way this movie was conceived and realized. The best movies about the future are really movies that look at the present and where we're heading, and this movie did that with aplomb, as it never stopped questioning the relationships between robots and humanity, and the \""rights\"" of the AI. Meanwhile, within all this, was a very touching and exciting movie. I still give Speilberg more credit for this movie than Kubrick, and think that Speilberg kept in a superb mix of dark and light, making this movie as captivating as it was."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.25
a-serious-man;9;MikeG.;;Nov 15, 2009;"[ ""I suppose the Book of Job comparisons are inevitable, but A Serious Man reminds me more of Barton Fink 40 years later. Larry Gopnik wanders the world looking for answers but like Fink is mostly oblivious to the world around him both from an emotional and spiritual standpoint. Unlike Job, Gopnik's unraveling is neither accidental nor random and is a product of his own actions or inaction. Thrown into all of this are the usual great touches by the Coens. They nail the period, throw in some great jokes, and mine some terrific performances out of the cast. This film isn't quite up to their best, but it does take me back to some of their older, quirkier stuff and is more lively than anything they've done in years."" ]";1.0;1.0;;;2.25
charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory;9;MikeG.;;Nov 12, 2005;"[ ""With a lot of pressure to live up to, Burton's version of \""Charlie\"" stakes out its own ground and soars on its own merits. This isn't the hippy-trippy early 70s colorful world of Willy Wonka, but instead a postmodern dark version of the tale, and probably far closer to what Dahl initially intended. The film works, entertaining as well as leaving you a little unsettled."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.25
a-history-of-violence;9;MikeG.;;Oct  4, 2005;"[ ""From the eerily silent first moments of the film, Cronenberg captures mood and never lets go of it throughout. A History of Violence might have been a mediocre gore fest in the hands of a lesser director, but Cronenberg keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film and leaves you wondering about not only these characters and this story, but about the world we live in. Viggo Mortensen slips marvelously into the lead role, capturing the duality of his life perfectly: there is an anonimity in his character that's delivered adroitly. There are some small holes in the plot, but you won't find yourself thinking about them until long after you leave the theater. William Hurt's performance is a little weird - is his character supposed to be funny? - but this is quibbling. A History of Violence is a movie worth seeing."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.25
v-for-vendetta;9;MikeG.;;Apr  7, 2006;"[ ""Very strong movie. Suprisingly, it was more of an intellectual exercise than an action movie or an emotional experience. This is perhaps the lone weakness of the movie - there are a couple of times where a more emotional wallop would have moved this movie to a 10. Otherwise, I found myself sucked into the story. Unlike a lot of other futuristic, totalitarian movies, the progression from here (the present) to there (the nightmarish future) was extremely believable."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.25
batman-begins;8;MikeG.;;Nov 12, 2005;"[ ""Solid movie that's elevated by Nolan's great direction, capturing the look and feel of what I'd always imagined Gotham would look like. Also does a great job of mixing the ordinary citizens and criminals with the superheroes, something the previous Batman movies had problems with. The result is a world that seems gritty and real while also seeming spectacular and otherwordly all at once."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.0
brokeback-mountain;8;MikeG.;;Jan  6, 2006;"[ ""Very good, but I have to agree with the \""overrated\"" crowd - if this was a movie about a man and a woman, it wouldn't be getting this kind of buzz. Still, for a story of starcrossed lovers, it's a very strong story. As much as the performances are being lauded, it's the writing that makes the performances strong, and Ang Lee's tremendous direction that prevents this movie from getting bogged down or too slow. Definitely enjoyable and worth the money. Just not the best film of 2005, let alone of the last five or ten years."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.0
the-40-year-old-virgin;8;MikeG.;;Nov 12, 2005;"[ ""Not the funniest comedy ever, but a lot of laughs, a star-making turn by Carell, and an excellent supporting cast. The movie is winning, though, because its all heart in the end, avoiding the easy way out of using the title character as a never ending gimmick. There are some scenes in this movie that people will be quoting and talking about for years."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.0
north-country;8;MikeG.;;Oct 26, 2005;"[ ""A strong film carried by mainly by the acting, particularly Bean and Jenkins in supporting roles, though the entire cast just jells here. Yes, the story is somewhat oversimplified, but the story still resonates. Despite what some of the critics say above, the dual storyline with mines/family enhances the movie. It's not the greatest story of this type ever told, but its pretty damn good."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.0
match-point;8;MikeG.;;Jan  7, 2006;"[ ""I was kind of muddling through this one throughout the first two thirds of the film, and was pretty unimpressed. It was kind of slow, kind of boring at times, and I agreed with some of the naysayers that the film was lacking any oomph. However, the end of the movie changed all of that for me. This film will hardly hold up with Allen's greatest works, but this was an extremely solid effort, and he took what could have been a completely vanilla movie and turned it into something my wife and I were talking about the rest of the night. No, it's not as good as \""Crimes and Misdemeanors\"" by any stretch of the imagination. But it is a good film by its own right, and is a very different film thematically. Here, Woody questions the ideas of luck, class, character, and opportunity very successfully. For those that say the dialogue is boring, I say you weren't paying attention enough to the story. There are several hints dropped along the way, and judgments are made about every character. The miracle here is that Scarlett Johansson's Nola, who at first glance seems like an airheaded nymph, turns out to be the moral center of the film. This film is a thinker; don't let the slow pace fool you. You won't get it if you're not paying full attention."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;2.0

up-in-the-air;7;MikeG.;;Jan 16, 2010;"[ ""What a difficult movie to grade. Everything was done \""right\"": the performances were magnificent (though it's Anna Kendrick, not George Clooney, who delivers the best performance), the jokes were funny, and the characters and story were propped up by an extremely strong script. The problem the movie had is that it delivered an interesting, compelling story in the first two thirds of the movie before falling back on conventional Hollywood narrative for the last third. For a movie this well written, you can't quite call it treacle, but for a movie that was shooting for such lofty heights, it felt like a swing and a miss. There's a lot of critical love for Up in the Air, but in the end there's something missing from this package. What starts as an intriguing look into the construct of what makes for a \""good\"" life goes off the rails and becomes nothing more than the usual moralizing about how there is a right way and a wrong way to live. Don't be fooled by what some are calling an \""unconventional\"" ending. The movie isn't a masterpiece because the ending insists on winners and losers instead of allowing for the gray areas that were apparent throughout most of the film."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;1.75
dead-snow;7;MikeG.;;Aug 13, 2009;"[ ""This movie is one of the best horror comedies i have seen all year. It starts of a little slow prior to the first killing, but it gets better. It has some comedy mixed in with a lot of blood and gore. This group of actors are perfect for this movie, it's a comedy but they take it seriously all throughout the movie. A tad bit predictable at some parts(when the army of zombies came from the snow). But all in all a great movie, a great watch if you would like to see a gory movie without getting scared silly. I give it a 7."" ]";0.0;0.0;;;1.75
